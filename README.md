#**Fraud Detection Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on building a reliable fraud detection model for credit card transactions. Using a dataset of transactions, the goal is to accurately classify legitimate and fraudulent
transactions, helping to minimize false positives while maximizing fraud detection rates. This analysis explores various machine learning techniques to ensure robust and effective results, ultimately contributing to better fraud prevention systems.

**Key Skills and Techniques**
- Data Preprocessing: Efficiently cleaned and prepared data by addressing class imbalance with resampling techniques like **SMOTE**, enabling better model performance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis **(EDA)**: Analyzed the transaction data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in both fraudulent and legitimate transactions, offering critical insights into factors that indicate fraud.
- Machine Learning Models: Deployed multiple classification models, including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. By tuning hyperparameters and using GridSearchCV**, the project achieved a balanced model with high precision and recall.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using **precision, recall, and AUC**, which allowed for fine-tuning to minimize false positives and enhance detection accuracy.
- Impactful Results
The final fraud detection model **achieved 90% precision and 88% recall, demonstrating a high ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while keeping the rate of false positives low**. The use of resampling techniques and model tuning ensured the model's robustness, providing a practical solution that can be directly applied in real-world financial systems.
